Title: Ray Tracer<br />
<br />
Project Description: This ray tracing program will be able to take in input of shapes with colors and positions and render out what the scene would look like from a defined camera position using modern ray tracing methods. Currently, the program uses important structs to produce a ppm file of a basic scene (A.K.A. the "Hello, World!" of graphics). I decided to write this program in c because I am mostly familiar with c syntax and wanted access to the low level control in hopes it would improve efficiency of the program.<br />
